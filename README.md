# Screengrab

Screen capture utility for Firefox.

This is derived from 0.99.04c of Screengrab (fix version) by Oleksandr Popov, except with the ads removed.  For the 
rationale behind the fork, see 
[my original post on the issue](http://www.nexisonline.net/index.php/2016/07/20/screengrab-clean-edition/), 
and [the followup](http://www.nexisonline.net/index.php/2016/07/20/screengrab-now-falsified-reviews/) exposing 
Oleksandr's intellectually dishonest practice of using spambots to provide false reviews and hide negative feedback. 
While he has valid reasons for using ads, the suppression of negative feedback is completely unacceptable.
